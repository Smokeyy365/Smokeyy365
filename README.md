## About Me 
I've liked coding since I entered High School, with the amount you can do with coding and the practically infinite possibilities it drew me in instantly and I've started with websites and Garry's Mod Coding and am the owner of Coastal Servers DarkRP with 80+ unique players on at a time during peak https://coastalservers.net .
